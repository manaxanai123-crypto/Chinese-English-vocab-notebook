# Chinese-English Vocab Notebook (สมุดคำศัพท์จีน-อังกฤษ)

A single-file, no-build flashcard app for memorizing Chinese and English vocabulary (with Thai translations). Runs entirely in the browser — no backend, no build step, no dependencies to install.

## Features

- Add vocabulary as **Chinese + pinyin + English** or as **English + Thai translation only** (Chinese fields are optional)
- Two practice modes:
  - **Quiz mode** — 4 multiple-choice options per question, 3 wrong answers randomly drawn from your other saved words
  - **Flashcard mode** — classic flip card with self-rating
- Spaced-repetition scheduling (Leitner-style boxes 1–5) drives which words come up for review
- Text-to-speech pronunciation via the browser's built-in `speechSynthesis` API
- Data is stored in the browser's `localStorage` — nothing leaves the device, no account needed
- Export/import a JSON backup to move data between browsers or devices
- Responsive layout, light/dark mode support

## Running locally

No build step needed. Just open `index.html` directly in a browser:

```bash
open index.html        # macOS
# or
xdg-open index.html    # Linux
# or just double-click it in your file explorer
```

For local development with live reload, any static file server works, e.g.:

```bash
npx serve .
# or
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repository (`index.html` should be at the repo root, or in `/docs` if you prefer).
2. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to "Deploy from a branch", pick your branch (e.g. `main`) and the folder (`/` or `/docs`).
4. Save. GitHub will publish the site at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

That's it — the whole app is one static HTML file, so no CI/build configuration is required.

## Notes on data storage

Vocabulary is saved with `localStorage`, scoped to the exact origin (domain) the page is served from. That means:

- Data saved while testing locally (`file://...`) will **not** carry over to the GitHub Pages version, and vice versa — they're different origins.
- Data does not sync across browsers or devices automatically. Use the **Stats → Backup/Restore** section in-app to export a `.json` file and import it elsewhere.

## Tech

Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no framework, no build tooling. Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts (Noto Serif SC for Chinese characters, Noto Sans Thai for Thai/English UI text) via a `<link>` tag — remove or self-host that if you need a fully offline/air-gapped build.
